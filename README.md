# PingableBsky
Made a template for my friend Ajay to scrape a user on Bsky and if they have a specific keyword it will notify on discord. Made this because it is a good template to use google sheets (so it's easy for users to view the data) and for the github action to run on a scheduled basis. It also has useful blocks of code that can be reused elsewhere.
